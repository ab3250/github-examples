;;; Example program - tail call optimization
;;;
;;; This example proves that a Scheme implements proper tail recursion
;;; (AKA tail call optimization, or TCO).
;;;
;;; TCO isn't just about self-calling. The following is expected to run 
;;; forever in scheme. It will use ~100% CPU, however memory usage is expected 
;;; to remain constant and a stack overflow should never occur.

(define (foo) (bar))
(define (bar) (foo))
(foo)
